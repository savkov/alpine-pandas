## What is this?

This is an image of Alpine linux with pandas installed. It's insane how long it takes to compile pandas on Alpine so 
there you go.

## Install

```shell script
docker pull quay.io/savkov/alpine-pandas
```

## Build

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/savkov/alpine-pandas.git 
make build
```
